<h2>👽 Alien Invasion</h2>
<p>Alien invasion is a clone of popular arcade game with same name. I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book. The reason was to improve my python skills.</p>

<h3>🚀 Introduction</h3><hr>

> <p>In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the
> > bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and
> > left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When
> > the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and
> > down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the
> > player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster
> > than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or
> > reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the
> > player loses three ships, the game ends.</p>
